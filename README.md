# Multi-Branch Development Project

This repository demonstrates a multi-branch development workflow with feature branches, hotfixes, and release branches. It includes a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and tests code across different branches.

## Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `hotfix/*` - Hotfix branches
- `release/*` - Release preparation branches

## Project Structure

```
.
├── src/               # Source code
├── tests/            # Test files
├── docs/             # Documentation
└── README.md         # This file
```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from develop:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature develop
   ```

2. Make changes and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```

3. Push to remote:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request to merge into develop

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline includes:
- Automated testing
- Code quality checks
- Security scanning
- Build verification
- Deployment to staging/production

## Security

- All secrets are stored in a secure vault
- Regular security audits are performed
- Dependencies are scanned for vulnerabilities
